<p>This is PyIRC, an IRC library designed to be flexible, extensible, usable, and
useful. It is entirely written in Python with no required external
dependencies.</p>

<p>This is a rewrite of a rewrite, so you may see PyIRC 3 sprinkled in some
comments. Much has been learned from the first two efforts (PyIRC 1 had many
issues with being too monolithic, and had too many Unicode problems due to
Python 2 compatibility. PyIRC 2 was a bad API design (using subclassing) that
never could be properly rewritten). Some of the code has been retained from
PyIRC 2, where appropriate.</p>

<p>See LICENSE for details on distribution of this README and the software itself.</p>

<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This library has been designed with standards compliance in mind and as a goal.
Relevant standards include <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html">RFC1459</a>,
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812.html">RFC2812</a>, and
<a href="http://ircv3.org">IRCv3</a>. RFC1459 and RFC2812 compliance is basically finished
(the different USER syntax in RFC2812 is not well-supported), as well as IRCv3.0
support. IRCv3.1 support should be fairly complete - if you notice any gaps,
please file a bug. Features of IRCv3.2 are mostly done, but may not be tested,
due to the lack of servers implementations.</p>

<p>The library presently supports the following in extensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Autojoin</li>
<li>STARTTLS</li>
<li>Message tags (some parsing is attempted, but largely untested yet)</li>
<li>SASL, PLAIN auth only right now</li>
<li>CAP </li>
<li>Scheduled events</li>
<li>Ability to hook any numeric/command and many events</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="http://github.com/Elizafox/PyIRC/blob/master/TODO.md">TODO</a> for the
list of planned features.</p>

<h2>
<a id="design" class="anchor" href="#design" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design</h2>

<p>PyIRC 3 is designed to be wholly uncoupled from the underlying I/O subsystem
whilst providing easy ways to ingest events. It is designed to work around
your event system, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Please note the library is not thread-safe at this time, although some locking
is implemented (mostly sendq related stuff). If such functionality is desired,
it will be added.</p>

<h2>
<a id="platforms" class="anchor" href="#platforms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platforms</h2>

<p>The library is completely cross-platform and should work anywhere Python does,
so long as it has a working socket implementation (SSL usage depends on your
Python build having support for the <code>ssl</code> module - this should be almost all
modern platforms).</p>

<p>PyIRC 3 requires Python 3.3 or newer. asyncio support requires either 3.4, or
for asyncio to be installed from PyPI.</p>

<h2>
<a id="bugs" class="anchor" href="#bugs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bugs</h2>

<p>Probably many! Tell us about them - see the support section or just file an
issue on the <a href="http://github.com/Elizacat/PyIRC/issues">bug tracker :)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="support" class="anchor" href="#support" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support</h2>

<p>Point your IRC client irc.interlinked.me #PyIRC for general questions, or file
an issue/pull request on github. Feature requests are also accepted this way.</p>
