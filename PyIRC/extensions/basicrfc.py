    """ Basic RFC1459 support.

    This is basically just a module that ensures your bot doesn't time out and
    can track its own nick. Nobody is making you use this implementation, but
    it is highly recommended.

    This extension implements the following user-facing attributes:

    nick
        Our present real nickname as reported by the IRC server.

    prev_nick
      If we get a NICK event from the server, and it's for us, our last nick
      will be stored here. Useful in case of services collisions that change
      our nick, SANICK/FORCENICK operator abuse, or another extension changes
      our nick.
