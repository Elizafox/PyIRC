"""Enumeration of IRC server features and extensions

ISUPPORT is a non-standard but widely supported IRC extension that is used to
advertise what a server supports to a client. Whilst non-standard, most
servers follow a standard format for many parameters.

The following should be safe:

- CHANTYPES (value is a string)
- PREFIX (value is of format "(modes)symbols for modes")
- NETWORK (value is a string)
- CASEMAPPING (ascii or rfc1459)
- NICKLEN (value is a number, but stored as a string)
- CHANMODES (list of values enumerating modes into four distinct classes,
  respectively: list modes, modes that send a parameter, modes that send a
  parameter only when set, and parameterless modes)

The following are common but not guaranteed:

- INVEX (no parameters)
- EXCEPTS (no parameters)
- TARGMAX (command:targets,command2:targets2,...)
- EXTBAN (a string, "prefix,extban prefixes")
