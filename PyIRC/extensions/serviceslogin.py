    """ Support services login.

    Use of this module is discouraged. Use the SASL module if at all
    possible. It is not possible to know if our authentication was
    a success or failure, because services may use any string to report
    back authentication results, and they are often localised depending on
    IRC network.

    It also creates a security hole, as you can never be 100% sure who or
    what you're talking to (though some networks support a full nick!user@host
    in the target to message a user).

                NickServ). Can be a full nick!user@host set for the networks
