    Provides a rough time difference between local and server time.

    :ivar delta:
        Current time delta measurement between server and client, computed as
        the difference between local time and server time. There is no
        guarantee the delta measurement will be accurate, but it should be
        accurate to within a few seconds under ideal conditions. Jitter may
        cause this value to be inaccurate. If the delta is high, you should
        check your local time, or contact an administrator on the server and
        let them know their time is out of sync. If the delta is set to `None`,
        then a delta measurement has not yet been performed (or cannot be).

    :ivar broken:
        Set to `True` if the server's time functionality is broken in some way.
        You may have to adjust `strptime_fmt` if it is. If it is set to
        `False`, the server's time functionality works fine. `None` is an
        indeterminate state.
